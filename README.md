Source code for the winning project for Best Data Visualization. "No Lawyer, No Voice" was project created during the Arizona Migrahack 2015 at University of Arizona in Tucson, March 20-22.

## About

Unaccompanied child migrants have survived a long and difficult trip to reach the U.S. border. Their next journey, through the court system, is often just as arduous.

The “No Lawyer, No Voice” project examined data on court proceedings for unaccompanied minors whose cases were filed in Arizona from October 2004 to February 2015. The data was collected from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University and prepared especially for Arizona Migrahack.

Team members found that children without lawyers were twice as likely to be deported. They were also likely to be transferred to another court or another state; some were transferred up to 10 times. The story of these statistics was told through an animated video, map, charts and an interactive graphic.

Judges were impressed by the breadth and depth of the project. They cited in particular the interactive graphic, which allows users to explore the data.
